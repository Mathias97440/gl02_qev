When the American 90s rock band Pearl Jam put on a concert in the dried-up, baking-hot Coachella Valley in California, it was an attempt to prove that they could break away from the monopoly of the concert giant TicketMaster, who, they believed, was using its considerable power to exploit music fans by continually increasing prices. Their concert was well attended and inspired the idea for a future, more ambitious event. Naturally, nobody could have predicted quite how important Coachella would eventually become.</p> -> 4.

If one band is responsible for confirming Coachella's arrival on the world stage, it is Daft Punk's iconic appearance there in 2006.  As a direct result of the festival's success, promoters expanded it to a three-day event, and in 2009, Coachella presented its most mainstream line-up, including Paul McCartney, the Killers, and The Cure. The following year Jay-Z became the first rap headliner and by 2012 such was the popularity of Coachella that it had developed into two weekends of three-day shows.</p> -> 2.

One smart move was to get a much-missed band or singer such as Rage Against the Machine to reform every year. Most notable was a holographic representation of the late rapper 2Pac in 2012. ln a stroke of genius, they decided to cater for the section of the audience who adored the music that used to be labelled electronic and who flocked to dance in big tents to their favourite DJs.</p> -> 1.
